# Breast_Cancer_Classification_DataScience_Project
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could assist in understanding the disease and supporting decision-making in healthcare. The analysis aims to provide statistical insights and predictive modeling to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

# Project Objectives

### Data Exploration:
Understanding the distribution of features.
Identifying correlations between attributes.
Visualizing patterns in the data.

### Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Normalizing/Scaling data for uniformity.
Feature selection and engineering.

## Model Development:
Building machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Insights & Recommendations:
Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
Recommending approaches for early detection and prevention.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:
pandas (Data Manipulation)
numpy (Numerical Computation)
matplotlib, seaborn (Data Visualization)
scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
